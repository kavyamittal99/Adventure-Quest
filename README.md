## JavaScript Logic:

i)The JavaScript code (script.js) drives the logic of the game. It uses variables like storyIndex and level to keep track of the player's progress and current level in the story. The storyText array holds the narrative for each stage of the adventure, and the funnyComments array stores humorous comments that can be displayed during specific moments.

ii)Function: startAdventure():
The startAdventure() function is called when the player clicks the "Start Adventure" button. It initializes the game by setting the storyIndex to 1, displaying the first story text, and showing the choice buttons. The function also clears any existing result messages and floating comments.

iii)Function: makeChoice(choice):
The makeChoice(choice) function is called when the player clicks one of the choice buttons. It determines the outcome of the player's decision and progresses the story accordingly. Depending on the choice made, the function updates the storyIndex to move to the next stage of the adventure or trigger specific events, such as funny comments or the appearance of the treasure image.

iv)Updating Choice Options:
The updateChoiceOptions() function updates the text displayed on the choice buttons based on the current stage of the story (defined by the storyIndex). For example, it changes the options when the player encounters a wolf or a dragon, providing different choices to the player.

v)Displaying Floating Comments:
The displayFloatingComment(comment) function is responsible for showing humorous floating comments on the screen. It creates a new HTML element for the comment, adds it to the "floating-comments" container, and removes it after a few seconds to avoid clutter.

vi)Winning and Game Over:
The game checks certain conditions (e.g., storyIndex === 6 or storyIndex === 7) to determine if the player has won or lost. When the player wins, the treasure image is displayed, and the choice buttons are hidden. When the player loses or makes a wrong choice, a "Game Over" message is shown, and the choice buttons are also hidden.
